Estimation of *dark matter halo mass* of galaxy groups in SDSS DR7 using 
a **machine learning** approach.

------------------------
Project Description
------------------------
This project focuses on the analysis of group masses via a machine learning 
approach. We estimate the mass of galaxy groups with machine learning.
The algorithm learns the features of a diverse set of galaxy groups 
in synthetic catalogues, and then tries to determine the mass of 
galaxy groups in the *data*.

The **main** repository of this project can be found at:
`SDSS Groups ML <https://www.githug.com/vcalderon2009/SDSS_Groups_ML>`_.
